        programme emphasises on the courses which have vast potential for applications in the area of computer sciences.
        It offers an exciting opportunity to those interested in Mathematics and wish to understand how Mathematics can
        be put to practical use. It discusses modelling and solving of real world problems in the context of computer
        applications. Studies in this two( 2) year programme are divided into four (4) semesters (2 semesters per year).
        The first semester is from January to June and the second semester is from July to December of each year.
        Objectives of the Programme This programme has the following broad objectives: to emphasise the relevance and
        usefulness of mathematics from an application point of view; to equip the learners with the core mathematical
        knowledge and training necessary for use in many application areas; to expose the learner to real-life problems
        and promote the use of mathematics in industry and applied sciences</p>
